# Comments are used to explain code when the basic code itself isn't clear.
# Python ignores comments, and so will not execute code in there, or raise syntax errors for plain English sentences.
# Single-line comments begin with the hash character(  # ) and are terminated by the end of line.
# Single line comment:


# This is a single line comment in Python

# Inline comment:

# Comments spanning multiple lines have """ or ''' on either end. This is the same as a multiline string, but
# they can be used as comments:

"""
This type of comment spans multiple lines.
These are mostly used for documentation of functions, classes and modules.
