# String are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Python allows for either
# pairs of single or double quotes. Strings are immutable sequence data type, i.e each time one makes any changes
# to a string, completely new string object is created.
a_str = 'Hello World'
print(a_str)  # output will be whole string. Hello World
print(a_str[0])  # output will be first character. H
print(a_str[0:5])  # output will be first five characters. Hello
